# dropnotificationsproject

# Public Repository for quick notification code

I am going to assume out the gate we will need the following:

#Initial Goals (Launch)
1. Secret Manager function to retrieve dumb user values
2. Scraper function to scrape post/story. I do not know if any of the existing scraper projects allow scraping stories directly if they do not exist.
3. Discord function to notify of 

#Long Term Goals (Pie in Sky, these are up for debate.)
1. Scraper function to interpret list of drops.
2. DynamoDB table with DiscordUser, Store#List, NotificationMethod
3. Advanced Discord function to IM DiscordUser with Store#(s) from list (and potentially Google Maps link to said Store#(s)).

This is all what I quickly threw together. Please consider this a working document and update with proposals.

You will find two quick and dirty scripts I wrote to initially test functions of openly available scraper projects.
